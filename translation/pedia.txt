# Slimes
t.pink_slime = 粉紅史萊姆
m.intro.pink_slime = 科學已證明他們的粉紅是微笑的顏色。
m.diet.pink_slime = 水果，蔬菜，肉類
m.favorite.pink_slime = （無）
m.slimeology.pink_slime = 粉紅史萊姆是 the Range 裡最常見的史萊姆，他們很快樂、溫馴，是 \
	最好養的史萊姆。 粉紅史萊姆會吃下放在他們面前的所有食物，因此沒有特別愛好的食物。 \
	他們的結晶在所有史萊姆結晶中是最便宜的。
m.risks.pink_slime = 不必太過擔心粉紅史萊姆。他們柔軟、黏糊糊、喜歡環繞在牧場主人身旁。 \
	能在 the Range 的各個角落發現他們。也因此，牧場主人能到處發現容易產生巨型史萊姆的粉紅結晶 \
	然後......
m.plortonomics.pink_slime = 粉紅結晶是優異的 「多重用途物質」，可以用來製造 \
	任何東西，像食物、清潔劑... 在地球上的任何角落，人們用粉紅結晶製品來製造漢堡、替咖啡提味  \
	或清潔地板。由此可見它的多用途！

t.rock_slime = 岩石史萊姆
m.intro.rock_slime = 他們含有真正的金屬！
m.diet.rock_slime = 蔬菜
m.favorite.rock_slime = 甜心菜
m.slimeology.rock_slime = 岩石史萊姆之所以稱為岩石史萊姆，是因史萊姆本體上的石質尖刺皇冠\
	But their affection for minerals doesn't end with their appearance: 岩石史萊姆是徹底的素食主義者 \
	他們特愛甜心菜咬起來嘎吱嘎吱的聲音。
m.risks.rock_slime = 很顯然的，岩石史萊姆的危險來自於他們尖銳的石質皇冠能穿透牧場主人的靴子。 \
	但僅關注你的腳邊並不夠，因為這些岩石史萊姆們總是在旋轉翻滾著。 \
	當你看到他們正在加速旋轉之時，最好離他們遠一點。
m.plortonomics.rock_slime = 岩石結晶被稱為生產「藍金屬」的重要元素。 藍金屬是 \
    是一種驚人的合金，能比鈦金屬還堅固，但卻比塑膠還輕，因其驚人的強度 \
    它通常作為生產光速星艦的船身、人造器官和全像投影器保護殼 \
    的關鍵元素。

t.tabby_slime = 斑貓史萊姆
m.intro.tabby_slime = 斑紋、尾巴、搖搖搖
m.diet.tabby_slime = 肉類
m.favorite.tabby_slime = 岩地母雞
m.slimeology.tabby_slime = 十分奇妙地，斑貓史萊姆和地球上被馴養的家貓有許多相似處，像是 \
    那漂亮的耳朵、條紋後背和那不斷擺動的尾巴。 如果他們沒有那黏稠的史萊姆身體，你幾乎\
    會將他們和貓科動物搞混。
m.risks.tabby_slime = 斑貓史萊姆通常不會對牧場主人造成威脅，但就像他們在地球上的斑貓親戚一樣， \
    他們經常製造大混亂，像是他們喜歡偷拿不吃的水果、蔬菜之類的， \
    導致 the Range 裡發生許多的巨型史萊姆轉換。
m.plortonomics.tabby_slime = 斑貓結晶在許多的「效能強化」製品裡是十分重要的關鍵材料 ，\
    能夠湧出豐富的斑貓史萊姆能量.。而正當世界各處的運動員們都過度使用它來提升自我極限， \
    才發現經常性的使用會造成「不可控制的搖屁股」—另一個 \
    （較不受歡迎的）斑貓史萊姆能量效果。

t.phosphor_slime =  磷光萊姆
m.intro.phosphor_slime = The softly glowing heralds of starlight.
m.diet.phosphor_slime = Fruit
m.favorite.phosphor_slime = Cuberry
m.slimeology.phosphor_slime = Phosphor slimes come out at night, flying about the moonlit range upon their translucent \
    wings. Phosphor slimes have a luminescent slime core that pulses with a soft glow, making them easy to spot. It's \
    for this reason ranchers sometimes refer to them as 'low stars.'
m.risks.phosphor_slime = Phosphor slimes have special needs compared to your typical slime. A phosphor slime and its \
    plorts will quickly vanish if exposed to sunlight, meaning a rancher could quickly lose an entire corral's worth \
    of phosphor slimes if they're not careful. Ranchers must either vac them up before daybreak or keep phosphor slimes in a \
    place that is perpetually dark, like a cave.
m.plortonomics.phosphor_slime = The luminescent compound found within phosphor plorts can produce light for over 100 \
    years, making it an incredibly eco-friendly form of illumination on Earth. Cities across the globe are slowly \
    switching over to phosphor lights, saving trillions of gigawatts of energy daily. Plus if you rub the stuff in your \
    hair, it glows and looks really cool.

t.rad_slime = Rad Slime
m.intro.rad_slime = Its radiance is so lovely it makes you sick.
m.diet.rad_slime = Veggies
m.favorite.rad_slime = Oca Oca
m.slimeology.rad_slime = It's unknown if rad slimes, sometimes called 'raddies,' came to be from external radiation \
    sources or from something naturally ocurring within the Far, Far Range. Regardless, rad slimes emit such a potent \
    aura of radiation they glow in the dark!
m.risks.rad_slime = A rad slime's radioactive aura can induce rad poisoning in a rancher if they remain within it for \
    too long. Ranchers are advised to monitor their rad exposure levels when handling these green globs of gamma goo \
    as extended exposure can cause serious bodily harm, or worse.
m.plortonomics.rad_slime = Given that raddies are basically mobile batteries, it’s no surprise that corporations value \
    rad plorts for their incredible energy-producing capabilities. Most rad plorts get turned into ‘plortonium’ and \
    everything from the latest holophone to a radwave microcook system runs on the stuff.

t.boom_slime = Boom Slime
m.intro.boom_slime = Careful, these slimes have been known to expl-
m.diet.boom_slime = Meat
m.favorite.boom_slime = Briar Hen
m.slimeology.boom_slime = Boom slimes are often heard before they're seen. The slime cells of a boom slime are \
    constantly vibrating, causing their slime to increasingly crackle with energy before ultimately exploding. \
    However, the boom slime always comes out unscathed, though always a little dazed.
m.risks.boom_slime = Boom slimes are constantly building toward an inevitable explosion, making them quite hazardous \
    to ranchers. In addition to those explosions causing bodily harm, they also have the capacity to send all nearby \
    slimes flying into the air, making them a hard slime to corral.
m.plortonomics.boom_slime = Highly volatile boom plorts have all sorts of applications, including powering rocket \
    thrusters and demolitions. Military organizations value their highly destructive capabilities for ‘medical \
    technology and other research.’ Imagine that!

t.honey_slime = Honey Slime
m.intro.honey_slime = 'Nothing is sweeter than (a recently produced plort of) honey.'
m.diet.honey_slime = Fruit
m.favorite.honey_slime = Mint Mango
m.slimeology.honey_slime = Honey slimes are an odd breed of slime composed of a hyper-sweet slime compound. Most slime \
    scientists believe this to be the result of their slime cells replicating the natural sugars found in the fruits \
    and floral nectars of the Far, Far Range. Most ranchers agree their plorts taste great on cereal.
m.risks.honey_slime = The greatest danger a honey slime poses is found in their plorts. Honey plorts are the sweetest, \
    most delicious plorts known on the Far, Far Range. Other slimes can detect them from much further away than a normal \
    plort and will do everything in their means to get them. A rancher with honey slimes needs to be careful about \
    unintended largos, or worse...
m.plortonomics.honey_slime = Honey plorts are highly prized by food manufacturers. Though the plorts are naturally \
    incredibly sweet, the discovery that they could be further refined into an even sweeter substance made their \
    demand soar. These refined honey plorts are said to score an unprecedented 867 on the Werner-Thompkins-Hong \
    sacchrino scale, just a few points shy of 'not fit for human consumption.'

t.hunter_slime = Hunter Slime
m.intro.hunter_slime = Nevermind the rabbit, have you seen any chickens?
m.diet.hunter_slime = Meat
m.favorite.hunter_slime = Roostro
m.slimeology.hunter_slime = The hunter slime is the wild cousin of the tabby slime. A much more capable creature than \
    the playful tabbies, the hunter slime excels at stalking the chickens of the Far, Far Range.\n\
    \n\
    A hunter slime's slimological makeup allows for a natural cloaking ability that renders it almost completely \
    invisible. Their only tell is in their giant, almond eyes, which can often be seen hovering in the dark. This \
    effect is often described by unsuspecting ranchers as 'aaaahhhhHHH!'
m.risks.hunter_slime = A hunter slime has keen senses and can detect its prey from great distances. This makes \
    finding a good location for their corrals challenging.\n\
    \n\
    Additionally, the wild nature of the hunter is also passed on to any largos formed form its plorts. A newly \
    created hunter largo will always be feral! A prepared rancher knows that breeding hunter largos should always be \
    done slowly, with a few chickens on hand to calm them down.
m.plortonomics.hunter_slime = Amazingly, a serum can be made from hunter slime plorts that can actually render a person \
    invisible! The effect only lasts for about a day, but this serum is nonetheless incredibly popular back on Earth \
    as many people find its effects very soothing.\n\
    \n\
    Sometimes you feel like you just want to disappear for a while. But then about a day goes by and you realize that \
    not only did you miss being seen, but others missed seeing you too.

t.puddle_slime = Puddle Slime
m.intro.puddle_slime = Keep one in your boot and you'll always stay cool. But it's weird.
m.diet.puddle_slime = Water
m.favorite.puddle_slime = (none)
m.slimeology.puddle_slime = Puddle slimes are a rare species of slime that live in fresh water pools found on the \
    range. These slimes don't eat fruits, veggies, or meat like most other slimes. Instead, puddle slimes absorb water \
    into their bodies while they sit on the surface of a pool.\n\
    \n\
    Puddle slimes need fresh water to survive and will quickly evaporate if left on any other surface for too long.
m.risks.puddle_slime = Puddle slimes aren't risky to manage, they just require a fair bit of maintenance. A rancher \
    needs a pool of fresh water, like a pond, available for a puddle slime to sit in as they will evaporate if away \
    from water. Additionally, puddle plorts burst as soon as they touch anything but fresh water.\n\
    \n\
    Finally, puddle slimes are exceptionally shy and will not produce plorts if they are in close proximity to more \
    than 3 other slimes.\n\
    \n\
    Overall, a puddle slime is a better fit for a more experienced rancher, not one still wet behind the ears.
m.plortonomics.puddle_slime = Puddle plorts are made almost entirely from an incredible hydro compound known by \
    chemists across the galaxy as H2Ohhhhh. This compound is used to create an absurdly expensive brand of bottled \
    drinking water that is sought after by the elite back on Earth. While some people argue that there is little \
    difference in taste between it and tap water, those people seriously are not getting it.

t.crystal_slime = Crystal Slime
m.intro.crystal_slime = It's as clear as shiny, transparent rocks that these slimes are dangerous.
m.diet.crystal_slime = Veggies
m.favorite.crystal_slime = Odd Onion
m.slimeology.crystal_slime = Believed to be a cousin of the rock slime, the crystal slime is covered in a crown of \
	shimmering, crystal spikes. These spikes seem to form from the crystal slime generating a tremendous amount of \
	internal heat and warping the minerals around them; a truly alien behavior.
m.risks.crystal_slime = The sharp crystals adorned on the crystal slime's crown will cause a great deal of harm if \
	touched. Worse still, the crystal slime routinely creates large patches of hazardous crystals in the \
	environment around them. Thought to be a means of expelling internal heat, these crystal patches are ultra-hot, \
	and can be shattered if splashed with water.
m.plortonomics.crystal_slime = Though the crystals prouduced by a crystal slime are highly unstable, a crystal plort, \
	like all plorts, is far more pure and can be used by slime scientists to engineer a variety of metals that are \
	completely transparent. This innovation has led to metropolitan areas on Earth completely transforming visually, \
	allowing more light to reach the streets and the space as a whole a chance to 'breathe.' Architects often describe \
	these transparent metals as 'so totally cooler than normal, boring metals.'


t.tarr_slime = The Tarr
m.intro.tarr_slime = Those awful, ravenous, rainbows.
m.diet.tarr_slime = Slimes
m.favorite.tarr_slime = Ranchers!
m.slimeology.tarr_slime = The tarr are formed when a largo eats a plort unlike the ones it produces. A terrible \
    transformation occurs that turns the slime into a sludge filled with a swirling, prismatic array of colors and a \
    relentless appetite. The tarr seek only to consume and replicate.\n\
    \n\
    The only way to stop a tarr outside of incinerating it or throwing it into the slime sea is with fresh water. One \
    splash will stop a tarr from spawning new tarr, and repeated splashes will destroy it entirely.\n\
    \n\
    Alternatively many ranchers recommend running away with their arms waving, and screaming.
m.risks.tarr_slime = The tarr are the single biggest threat to ranchers. The tarr will seek out slimes to consume \
    and replicate themselves, but will also devour chickens, rot crops in their proximity, and even devour ranchers! \n\
    \n\
    Remember: ranching largos may be highly profitable, but one stray plort and you could wind up with a devastating \
    tarr outbreak.
m.plortonomics.tarr_slime = The tarr produce no plorts, only more tarr. And then more tarr still.

t.gold_slime = Gold Slime
m.intro.gold_slime = Get rich or die sliming.
m.diet.gold_slime = Exclusive
m.favorite.gold_slime = (none)
m.slimeology.gold_slime = The most elusive and sought after of all slime species is easily the gold slime. Very little \
    is known about these slippery creatures as they have proven impossible to capture. Gold slimes are quick as a flash \
    and will immediately begin to flee ranchers on sight. If a rancher is to profit from an encounter with a gold slime, \
    they need to think quick.
m.risks.gold_slime = Gold slimes produce no direct risks to a rancher but their appearance often induces panic and \
    leads to (sometimes fatal) mistakes. Further, the only way to obtain gold plorts is to strike a gold slime with \
    any spare resources in your vac. Doing so can produce a gold plort, though it also leaves a trail of additional \
    resources in the area, leading to unintended largos, or worse.
m.plortonomics.gold_slime = Gold plorts have little practical use and are the most valuable of all plorts simply \
    because they are shiny and rare. Back on Earth, the elite love to adorn themselves in jewelry made of gold plorts, \
    far exceeding the value of any terrestrial precious metal. For this reason a rancher should never pass up the \
    chance to get a gold plort or two from a chance encounter with a gold slime.

t.lucky_slime = Lucky Slime
m.intro.lucky_slime = Oooh, shiny!
m.diet.lucky_slime = Meat
m.favorite.lucky_slime = (none)
m.slimeology.lucky_slime = Lucky slimes are a strange variant of tabby slimes that seem to have a fascination with \
    shiny objects, particularly newbuck coins. A lucky slime gobbles up any coin it can find, giving it a distinct \
    jingling sound as they move about.\n\
    \n\
    However, coins don't make for a balanced diet and a lucky slime will still greedily devour meat of any kind. In \
    so doing, its body bursts with a shower of newbucks, having little room left in its slimy tummy. This burst often \
    sends the lucky slime flying into the air.\n\
    \n\
    Upon detecting a rancher, the lucky slime will soon make a hasty retreat. No known rancher has ever been skillful \
    enough, or perhaps lucky enough, to capture one of these slippery slimes.
m.risks.lucky_slime = Lucky slimes pose the same risk to ranchers as other rare slimes: mainly, accidents in their \
    pursuit that can lead to a rancher's demise. The promise of a small fortune when encountering a lucky slime has \
    led more than a few ranchers head-first into the slime sea.\n\
    \n\
    This occurence has led some of the more superstitious ranchers to see the lucky slime as a bad omen, or perhaps as \
    the universe testing their greed. These ranchers will ignore lucky slimes altogether, even purposefully shooing \
    them away. Well, until you hear those newbucks jingling, and then, maybe just one shot couldn't hurt...
m.plortonomics.lucky_slime = A lucky slime isn't known to produce plorts of any kind. Leading slime scientists believe \
    this to be the result of the lucky slime not being a true slime variant. Rather, lucky slimes are believed to be just \
    an abnormal tabby slime: one whose color has faded as a result of ingesting so many coins. It is perhaps this very \
    change that also led to ceasing plort production.

t.largo_slime = Largo Slimes
m.intro.largo_slime = There's just more to love.
m.diet.largo_slime = (source slime's diet)
m.favorite.largo_slime = (source slime's favorite)
m.slimeology.largo_slime = Largo slimes are a hybrid of two slimes resulting from a slime eating a plort unlike its own. \
	They are twice as big as normal slimes and have a combined diet of their two source slimes, making them enticing for \
	ranchers that want to maximize their profits. \n\
	\n\
	However, a largo is too big to vac and can only be transported using the end of the vac nozzle. This makes \
	them difficult to control if things get out of hand.
m.risks.largo_slime = In addition to largos being more difficult to manage and having the combined powers of two \
	slimes, an even greater threat to ranchers lies within these super-sized slimes. If a largo eats a plort \
	unlike its two source slimes, it will transform into a ravenous tarr slime! \n\
	\n\
	Ranchers need to be very careful when dealing with largos or risk an outbreak of tarr that can quickly overtake \
	their entire ranch. Always carry a full tank of water just in case!
m.plortonomics.largo_slime = When a largo eats, it produces plorts of both source slime types, making them potentially \
	very lucrative for ranchers that can deal with the added risk of keeping them.

t.gordo_slime = Gordo Slimes
m.intro.gordo_slime = Bon appetit!
m.diet.gordo_slime = (source slime's diet)
m.favorite.gordo_slime = (source slime's favorite)
m.slimeology.gordo_slime = Gordo slimes are a rare phenomenon that occurs when multiple slimes of the same type \
	congregate. The result is that the slimes seem to merge together into a much larger slime that is seemingly \
	incapable of movement. \n\
	\n\
	A gordo will eat until it bursts, causing all the slimes to separate once more, as well as revealing whatever \
	object it was that caused the gordo to form in the first place.
m.risks.gordo_slime = Gordos pose no real risk to ranchers, they can only sometimes be a nuisance in that they \
	are hiding something a rancher might need. So if you see a gordo, feed it!
m.plortonomics.gordo_slime = Gordos produce no plorts on their own, however the slimes they produce after \
	bursting do like any normal slime.

t.feral_slime = Feral Slimes
m.intro.feral_slime = It's hard to be nice on an empty stomach.
m.diet.feral_slime = (source slime's diet)
m.favorite.feral_slime = (source slime's favorite)
m.slimeology.feral_slime = Feral slimes are largos with a mean streak that will attack a rancher on sight. \
	It's not known what exactly causes a largo to become so grumpy that it goes feral, but it's suspected \
	that they've simply gone too long without a bite to eat. Like so many things with slimes, food is everything. \n\
	\n\
	If a feral slime eats, it will revert to a normal largo.
m.risks.feral_slime = Feral slimes can pose a serious risk to ranchers if they're not dealt with quickly, or \
	avoided altogether. Feral slimes will attempt to bite ranchers at close range or jump in the air and try \
	to stomp them with their... butts? In any case, a rancher needs to act fast and feed the feral slime something \
	tasty to avoid such troubles.
m.plortonomics.feral_slime = Feeding a feral slime not only calms it down, but it also produces plorts in the same \
	manner as a largo. Though, there are certainly easier ways out there to acquire plorts!

# Resources
t.carrot = Carrot
m.intro.carrot = Next to a vacpack, it's a rancher's best friend.
m.favored_by.carrot = (none)
m.resource_type.carrot = Veggie
m.how_to_use.carrot = Deposit a carrot into a garden's depositor and you'll have a large carrot crop of your very own. \
    This crop will last for several harvests.
m.desc.carrot = The humble carrot was brought to the Far, Far Range because they're easy to grow and nutritious. \
	Most ranchers swear by them as they're a handy portable snack, promote good night vision, and when juiced \
	are second only to coffee as the perfect morning beverage.

t.ocaoca = Oca Oca
m.intro.ocaoca = A tubular mix of colorful spuds.
m.favored_by.ocaoca = Rad Slime
m.resource_type.ocaoca = Veggie
m.how_to_use.ocaoca = Deposit an oca oca into a garden's depositor and you'll have a large oca oca crop of your very own. \
    This crop will last for several harvests.
m.desc.ocaoca = A staple of cooking on the range, the hearty oca oca is a naturally salty, soft spud. As the key \
    ingredient to the always tasty 'rancher's hashbrowns' they have likely been the fuel for a great deal of slime \
    wrangling since their discovery on the range.

t.beet = Heart Beet
m.intro.beet = If you listen to it closely, you can faintly hear a veggie.
m.favored_by.beet = Rock Slime
m.resource_type.beet = Veggie
m.how_to_use.beet = Deposit a heart beet into a garden's depositor and you'll have a large heart beet crop of your very own. \
    This crop will last for several harvests.
m.desc.beet = Heart beets get their name from their deep, red color and heart-like shape. Heart beets are also \
    unusually juicy for a beet, making it the only veggie that's not for the squeamish in the kitchen.

t.onion = Odd Onion
m.intro.onion = I wouldn't trust this onion, even less so than a normal onion.
m.favored_by.onion = Crystal Slime
m.resource_type.onion = Veggie
m.how_to_use.onion = Deposit an odd onion into a garden's depositor and strangely, carrots will begin to grow. However, \
	there is a good chance you'll get some odd onions in the crop as well. This crop will last for several harvests. 
m.desc.onion = Odd onions can only be foraged in the wild from the Indigo Quarry; however, you'll never encounter an odd \
	onion patch. Instead, odd onions can be found randomly in other veggie patches. As the saying goes, 'forage in the Indigo \
	Quarry and you'll always find the odd onion in your haul.'

t.parsnip = Silver Parsnip
m.intro.parsnip = Like a carrot's rich, sophisticated cousin. Also, it's silver.
m.favored_by.parsnip = Meteor Slime
m.resource_type.parsnip = Veggie
m.how_to_use.parsnip = Deposit a silver parsnip into a garden's depositor and you'll have a large silver parsnip crop of your very own. \
    This crop will last for several harvests.
m.desc.parsnip = Despite their slightly metallic aftertaste, these shimmering root veggies are considered a delicacy \
    by gourmands across the galaxy. On the Far, Far Range, ranchers often eat them during the holidays, to bring good \
    fortune in the coming year.

m.how_to_use.pogo = Deposit a pogofruit into a garden's depositor and you'll grow a large pogofruit tree of your very \
    own. This tree will last for several harvests.
m.desc.pogo = Pogofruit are a common sight almost anywhere on the Far, Far Range. Tasting a bit like a peach, they're \
    most notable for having their trademark spots both on and under the skin.

m.how_to_use.mango = Deposit a mint mango into a garden's depositor and you'll grow a large mint mango tree of your \
    very own. This tree will last for several harvests.
m.desc.mango = The mint mango is perhaps the sweetest fruit ever discovered. Its appearance is that of a mango, with a \
    thicker, syrup-like juice, and a bright, minty aftertaste. It's no wonder honey slimes seek them out or that they \
    have such amazingly fresh breath.

t.cuberry = Cuberry

m.desc.chickadoo = Chickadoos are baby chickens that will eventually grow into a hen hen or more rarely, a roostro.\n\
    \n\
    Chickadoos of all varieties will never be eaten by slimes. Some believe this is because slimes are too kind-hearted \
    to do such a thing. Others believe it's because chickadoos don't yet have enough meat on their bones.

t.henhen = Hen Hen
m.intro.henhen = A hearty chicken bred to be twice as tasty as its cousin on Earth.
m.favored_by.henhen = (none)
m.resource_type.henhen = Meat
m.how_to_use.henhen = Hen hens in close proximity to roostros will periodically lay eggs that produce chickadoos. \
    However, keeping too many hens or roostros in close proximity makes them anxious and egg production will come \
    to a halt. Savvy ranchers with an understanding of the complex nature of chicken romance always keep their \
    coops from exceeding 12 grown chickens.
m.desc.henhen = Hen hens are a special breed of chicken bred to survive the climate of the Far, Far Range. \
    While appearing more or less like a big chicken, these burly birds are much more adept at fending for themselves, \
    making them ideal for ranchers who might otherwise be distracted by a few hundred hungry slimes.

t.stony_hen = Stony Hen
m.intro.stony_hen = Has a rock solid conviction... in chicken stuff.
m.favored_by.stony_hen = Tabby Slime
m.resource_type.stony_hen = Meat
m.how_to_use.stony_hen = Stony hens in close proximity to roostros will periodically lay eggs that produce stony chickadoos. \
    However, keeping too many hens or roostros in close proximity makes them anxious and egg production will come \
    to a halt. Savvy ranchers with an understanding of the complex nature of chicken romance always keep their \
    coops from exceeding 12 grown chickens.
m.desc.stony_hen = Stony hens are thought to have evolved from hen hens who once trekked deep into the mountains of the Far, Far \
    Range. Perhaps these birds were seeking a clarity of mind that one can only truly obtain through meditation amongst those \
    lofty, barren crags. But most likely, they were just stupid and got lost.

t.briar_hen = Briar Hen
m.intro.briar_hen = A real wild bird that loves to ramble in the bramble.
m.favored_by.briar_hen = Boom Slime
m.resource_type.briar_hen = Meat
m.how_to_use.briar_hen = Briar hens in close proximity to roostros will periodically lay eggs that produce briar chickadoos. \
    However, keeping too many hens or roostros in close proximity makes them anxious and egg production will come \
    to a halt. Savvy ranchers with an understanding of the complex nature of chicken romance always keep their \
    coops from exceeding 12 grown chickens.
m.desc.briar_hen = Briar hens are a chicken variant born from the wild thickets of the Far, Far Range. They were first discovered \
    long ago by an explorer who noted that they seemed to have a complex tribal structure, and a fascinating series of chicken \
    customs. He even may have joined the briar tribe as an honorary chicken himself! His records end there however, and we know \
    nothing else about him or his findings. Oh, but his name was Carl. We know that.

t.roostro = Roostro
m.intro.roostro = Struts his stuff like he's king of the coop.
m.favored_by.roostro = Hunter Slime
m.resource_type.roostro = Meat
m.how_to_use.roostro = All hens in close proximity to roostros will periodically lay eggs that produce chickadoos. \
    However, keeping too many hens or roostros in close proximity makes them anxious and egg production will come to a \
    halt. Savvy ranchers with an understanding of the complex nature of chicken romance always keep their coops from \
    exceeding 12 grown chickens.
m.desc.roostro = Roostros are the alpha birds on the Far, Far Range and half of the equation required to breed \
    chickens on the ranch. However, roostros are rarer than any hen making them a great find any time one is discovered.\n\
    \n\
    To acquire a roostro, either find one out on the range or breed them on the ranch. Any type of chickadoo has a small \
    chance of growing into a roostro. Some ranchers believe that these odds increase if you greet the Rooster King's \
    crow at sunrise with an enthusiastic 'good morning!'

t.elder_roostro = Elder Roostro
m.intro.elder_roostro = Shakes his tail feathers and no one cares.
m.favored_by.elder_roostro = (none)
m.resource_type.elder_roostro = Meat
m.how_to_use.elder_roostro = An elder roostro can no longer sire chickadoos and serves no other purpose than becoming a \
    slightly tough chicken dinner.
m.desc.elder_roostro = Elder roostros are the senior-aged roostros who have retired from the otherwise bustling life of their \
    younger counterparts. 'Young roostros crow too much, they move too fast, and frankly have no respect for their elders,' \
    an elder roostro might say of youths; as they make a gross, smacking sound with their lips. Though this is of course \
    impossible, as roostros do not have lips.

t.elder_hen = Elder Hen
m.intro.elder_hen = An old bird whose egg-laying days are over, easy.
m.favored_by.elder_hen = (none)
m.resource_type.elder_hen = Meat
m.how_to_use.elder_hen = An elder hen can no longer lay eggs and serves no other purpose than becoming a slightly \
    tough chicken dinner.
m.desc.elder_hen = Elder hens have lived a full-feathered life. They've met the roostro of their dreams, seen their \
    little chickadoos grow up, and are ready to start the next chapter of their chicken lives. In all likelihood this will \
    include getting the names of countless books, movies and actors wrong. But don't blame them for that. They're chickens \
    for goodness sake.

# Ranch Tech
t.corral = Corral
m.intro.corral = A happy slime makes for a happy rancher.
m.desc.corral = A corral is used to keep slimes on a ranch. The open-air corrals are designed for maximum \
	slime satisfaction, with the rich soil of the Range beneath them and its expansive sky above them. \
	Slimes will remain perfectly happy within corrals so long as they are fed regularly.\n\
    \n\
    Remember: You can shoot things THROUGH a corral barrier. Handy!
m.upgrade.name.corral.walls = High Walls
m.upgrade.desc.corral.walls = Higher corral walls ensure that even the bounciest of slimes will have difficulty escaping.
m.upgrade.name.corral.music_box = Music Box
m.upgrade.desc.corral.music_box = The music box plays a soothing tune that greatly reduces slime agitation.
m.upgrade.name.corral.air_net = Air Net
m.upgrade.desc.corral.air_net = An air net is a force barrier that covers the top of a corral. It can take a few hits before needing to recharge.
m.upgrade.name.corral.solar_shield = Solar Shield
m.upgrade.desc.corral.solar_shield = A solar shield will encase a corral in a dim shade, protecting slimes sensitive to light.
m.upgrade.name.corral.plort_collector = Plort Collector
m.upgrade.desc.corral.plort_collector = A plort collector will vacuum up two types of plorts in a corral at regular \
    intervals, depositing them into a storage tank, so long as space is available.
m.upgrade.name.corral.feeder = Auto-Feeder
m.upgrade.desc.corral.feeder = An auto-feeder will drop food into the corral at regular intervals. Just \
    remember to keep it stocked!

t.coop = Coop
m.intro.coop = Keeping chickens in their place prevents the uprising.
m.desc.coop = Though many ranchers simply let their chickens roam the ranch, a coop is the tool of the serious \
	poultry producer. Coops keep hens and roostros close, allowing for maximum egg-laying potential. Just \
	remember to avoid crowding the coop: chickens won't reproduce when in close proximity to more than a dozen \
	other hens or roostros. But give them room and watch the love bloom.
m.upgrade.name.coop.walls = High Walls
m.upgrade.desc.coop.walls = Great for keeping chickens in and hungry slimes out.
m.upgrade.name.coop.feeder = Spring Grass
m.upgrade.desc.coop.feeder = Spring grass attracts scuttle bugs that chickens just love to eat. With their bellies \
    full, hens will produce eggs twice as fast.
m.upgrade.name.coop.vitamizer = Vitamizer
m.upgrade.desc.coop.vitamizer = The very latest in advanced poultry tech, the vitamizer bathes the chickens in \
    'vita-rays,' allowing them to grow into healthy hens and roostros twice as fast.

t.garden = Garden
m.intro.garden = Nothing beats the taste of food grown in your own backyard.
m.desc.garden = The gardens used by ranchers use advanced technology to rapidly grow clones of fruits and \
	veggies in a natural, though greatly sped up, way. By placing a sample into the replicator, the garden's \
	soil is instantly populated by a fruit tree or veggie patch that will go on to produce several harvests of produce.
m.upgrade.name.garden.sprinkler = Sprinkler
m.upgrade.desc.garden.sprinkler = A sprinkler ensures that your crops are always watered, making them grow twice as fast.
m.upgrade.name.garden.soil = Nutrient Soil
m.upgrade.desc.garden.soil = Nutrient soil contains compost from the Moss Blanket and minerals from the Indigo \
	Quarry. Makes crops always yield the maximum harvest.
m.upgrade.name.garden.scareslime = Scareslime
m.upgrade.desc.garden.scareslime = A scareslime is a stuffed tarr model designed to keep wandering slimes away from \
    your crops. Simple, but terrifying.

t.silo = Silo
m.intro.silo = You can't take it with you when you go, so put it in storage.
m.desc.silo = A silo lets a rancher neatly store plorts and resources in a handy, compact unit. Simply shoot into \
	an available silo port to fill it, or vac it to retrieve the items within. Remember, a clean ranch is a happy ranch!
m.upgrade.name.silo.storage2 = Additional Storage
m.upgrade.desc.silo.storage2 = A silo can have up to four ports for storing plorts and resources.

t.incinerator = Incinerator
m.intro.incinerator = Don't need it? Burn it!
m.desc.incinerator = An incinerator will instantly burn anything it touches into ash, and then burn that ash into \
	nothing. It's an excellent solution for eliminating a tarr outbreak or for simply disposing of unwanted \
	slimes if you're a terrible, heartless monster.

t.pond = Pond
m.intro.pond = Water you going to do with this?
m.desc.pond = A pond gives you a source of fresh water on the ranch that you can use for watering gardens, calming \
    slimes in a corral, defeating tarr, or giving your puddle slimes a place to hang out.\n\n\
    A pond will be slowly consumed if vac'd up or drunk up by puddle slimes, but will also slowly refill over time. \
    You can transfer unused water from your vacpack to a pond, and they will refill immediately when it rains.

t.plort_market = Plort Market
m.intro.plort_market = Feed slimes. Collect plorts. Get paid.
m.desc.plort_market = The plort market is a network of buyers and sellers of plorts across the galaxy. Ranchers use \
    plort market machines on their ranch to send plorts to the market for sale. Ranchers are paid immediately when \
    depositing plorts at the plort's current market value.\n\n\
    Plort market values fluctuate and some of the more savvy ranchers will hoard certain plorts for days when sale \
    prices are high, especially rare plorts.

t.overgrowth = Overgrowth
m.intro.overgrowth = The ranch's very own wild side.
m.desc.overgrowth = The overgrowth is an expansion to the ranch that is covered in moss and tall grasses. The \
    thicket it creates allows for fruits and veggies to grow naturally and attracts the occasional wild chicken, \
    making it an ideal space for a rancher that wants to let their slimes roam more freely.
t.grotto = The Grotto
m.intro.grotto = A dark and gloomy cavern above the sea and a likely first chapter to that novel of yours.
m.desc.grotto = The grotto is an expansion to the ranch set inside a (slightly spooky) cave that allows a rancher to \
    care for light-sensitive slimes without the need for a solar shield. Never has a phosphor slime felt so liberated.

# Range
t.reef = The Dry Reef
m.intro.reef = A coral-crusted ocean floor that now basks under a golden sun.
m.desc.reef = The environment surrounding the ranch is known as the Dry Reef and is an arid, wind-swept land covered \
    in dusty crags and rocky cliffs shaped by the wind over the millennia.\n\
    \n\
    The Dry Reef is primarily home to pink, tabby, and rock slimes though phosphor slimes will also come out of \
    hiding when the sun sets. The Dry Reef's climate doesn't make for an abundance of any particular resource, but plenty \
    of carrots, pogofruit, and hen hens are everywhere, as well as some less common resources if you know where to look.

t.quarry = The Indigo Quarry
m.intro.quarry = All that remains of a mining project that quickly went bust.
m.desc.quarry = The Indigo Quarry is a winding network of caves and cliffs, striated with deep purple hues from the rare \
    minerals found within it. It was once the site of a mining project but went bust after the discovery that the rare ores \
    it produces quickly break down in atmospheres other than that of the Far, Far Range.\n\
    \n\
    It was later discovered that the means to harness these metals was via rock slime plorts. Somehow, rock slime plorts \
    preserve the minerals within, a process that eludes even the most prestigious slime scientists.\n\
    \n\
    The Indigo Quarry is a natural home for rock slimes and the more elusive rad slime, and its naturally mineral-rich soil \
    make it a great place to harvest most wild veggies.

t.moss = The Moss Blanket
m.intro.moss = Like a flower blooming from a rocky crack, this emerald expanse hints at what could be.
m.desc.moss = The Moss Blanket is an island covered in a thick layer of moss where flora grows wild in great, tangling \
    knots at every turn. The high walls of the cliffs surrounding the island and its great canopy of trees allow for sea \
    mists to pass in and become trapped, creating a unique climate within the otherwise arid range.\n\
    \n\
    The slimes primarily found within the Moss Blanket find its jungle-like conditions perfect: tabby and boom slimes \
    hunt their prey through the thickets with abandon, and honey slimes lounge in the flower beds, eating the great \
    abundance of fruit that can be found at every turn.

t.desert = The Glass Desert
m.intro.desert = TBD
m.desc.desert = TBD

t.sea = The Slime Sea
m.intro.sea = An expansive body of water and slime compound that's not fit for swimming, let alone drinking.
m.desc.sea = The Slime Sea that covers most of the Far, Far Range is something of a mystery. It is seemingly a mixture \
    of water and slime that is believed to be the primordial pool whence all slimes emerged, though its true purpose is \
    entirely unknown by even the most esteemed slime scientists.\n\
    \n\
    What is known is that the liquid found within the Slime Sea is not fit for drinking, watering crops, or even \
    swimming, as most things seem to quickly sink to the bottom. When a slime enters the slime sea it quickly vanishes \
    but it is widely believed that this far from ends the slime's existence, for slimes that enter the sea can often \
    be seen quickly reappearing back on land, happy as ever. In fact, many slime scientists believe that slimes use the \
    sea as a means of transportation, moving swiftly below the surface and popping out on land wherever they see fit.\n\
    \n\
    But all theories aside, one fact remains very clear, most especially to ranchers: don't enter the Slime Sea!

t.the_ranch = The Ranch
m.intro.the_ranch = A distant home for distant hearts.
m.desc.the_ranch = Beatrix begins her life on a humble ranch in the middle of an area of the Far, Far Range known as the \
    Dry Reef. Once the property of the legendary slime rancher and notorious old codger, Hobson Twillgers, the ranch \
    has seen better days, as Hobson let it come into a state of disrepair shortly before disappearing completely.\n\
    \n\
    Hobson's whereabouts are currently unknown.

t.keys = Slime Keys
m.intro.keys = An ancient key for an ancient lock.
m.desc.keys = Slime Keys are large, stone keys that are used to open the ancient slime gates across the range. \
    These gates often lead to new areas to explore or create shortcuts to familiar ones.
